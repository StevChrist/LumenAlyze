# LumenALYZE

Visit website : https://lumenalyze.vercel.app/

LumenALYZE is a full-stack machine learning platform built with FastAPI backend and Next.js TypeScript frontend. It provides a complete workflow for data analysis, from CSV file upload and preprocessing (handling missing values, normalization, outlier removal) to three core machine learning tasks: prediction (Random Forest and MLP), anomaly detection (Isolation Forest), and segmentation (K-Means clustering). The backend is modularly organized with config, models, services, and utils folders, while the frontend features interactive visualizations using Plotly.js, a results dashboard, and export to CSV/JSON/Excel. The app uses a custom color scheme (#014F39, #FBF7C7, #E8E8E6, #120F0A), Montserrat and Lora typography, comprehensive error handling, TypeScript type safety, and responsive design.

## How To Use

1. **Upload Your Data:**  
   - Click on the upload area or drag and drop your CSV/Excel file.
   - Supported formats: `.csv`, `.xlsx`, `.xls`.
   - Max file size: 50MB.
   - Ensure your file has at least one numeric column for analysis.

2. **Preview Your Data:**  
   - Review the data preview table for accuracy.
   - Verify column names and data types.
   - Check the number of rows and columns detected.

3. **Choose Analysis Type:**  
   - **Prediction:** Forecast values or classify data points.
   - **Anomaly Detection:** Identify unusual patterns or outliers.
   - **Segmentation:** Group similar data points into clusters.

4. **Configure Model (Optional):**  
   - Adjust model parameters as needed.
   - For anomaly detection, set the expected percentage of anomalies.

5. **View Results:**  
   - Results are shown in interactive charts and dashboards.
   - Export results to CSV, JSON, or Excel.
